# Background: Performance

> Script execution delays interactivity in a few ways:
> 
> * If the script executes for more than 50ms, time-to-interactive is delayed by the entire amount of time it takes to download, compile, and execute the JS
> * Any DOM or UI created in JS is not available for use until the script runs
